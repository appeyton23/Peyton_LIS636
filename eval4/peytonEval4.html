      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
        <p>The Toledo Library website at <a href="www.toledolibrary.org" alt="Toledo Library Website" id="Toledo_Website">www.toledolibrary.org</a> has many simple and user-friendly design components. As a library website, it appears to be similar to websites for entertainment more than it is similar to most public library websites. It has a clean, simple design, and many of the “Laws of User Experience,” <a href="lawsofux.com" alt="Laws of User Experience Website" id="ux_website">(lawsofux.com)</a> can apply to this website in a positive manner (Yablonski, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>For this evaluation, the main highlights section (see picture below) will be focused on as it applies to the Law of Similarity. The term “main highlights section” is referring to the three boxes that make up the top view of the home page.

      <h2 id="lit_review">The Law of Similarity:</h2>
        <p>The Law of Similarity will be analyzed specifically in relation to this section of the Toledo Library website mentioned above. The Law of Similarity states that items which are similar in characteristics tend to be visually paired together as one whole section. In Jon Yablonski’s (2019) Laws of User Experience website <a href="lawsofux.com" alt="Laws of User Experience Website" id="ux_website">(lawsofux.com)</a>, the law is defined as the tendency for “the human eye...to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.”
        </p>
        <p>At first glance, this law is relatively simple in concept, but the effect of ignoring this law in any design aspect can lead to major flaws and affect the appeal of the item designed. William Craig (2010), President of Web FX, a design company, wrote on the negative impact of neglecting the law of similarity, and he specifically gives the example of People Magazine’s error in separating John McCain’s adopted daughter from the rest of the family by placing her picture at the bottom of the cover of an edition. This neglect led to readers naturally believing that John McCain did not value his adopted daughter, though the picture was not designed to portray this idea to the magazines’ readers. Therefore, the law of similarity is an easy concept to understand, but it can easily lead to large misunderstandings in designs if it is neglected.
        </p>
        <p>The Law of Similarity is part of the Gestalt Principles which concerns multiple laws about human perception that can overlap and work in combination with each other.  A brief examination of the Gestalt Principles will aid in our understanding of the Law of Similarity. Mads Soegaard (2019) mentions that the word “Gestalt” carries great meaning amongst the design world.
        </p>
        <p>“Gestalt” is a German word loosely translated to “form” or “pattern,” and Gestalt psychology was the beginning of     these laws with it’s start being in Germany in the early 20th century (“Gestalt psychology,” 2019). These psychologists built the foundation of Gestalt psychology on the first law, Prägnanz, which states that “humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns” (Yablonski, n.d.). In summary, the Gestalt Principles are laws which state that the human eye’s perception naturally gives meaning to “visual elements” or constructs (Soegaard, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>As part of Gestalt’s Principles, the Law of Similarity applies across design types and platforms, and if done correctly, can ensure that the structure and hierarchy of a design is rightly perceived by the viewer. The areas of design observed were visual communication, web, and general art design, and each of these were based on the Gestalt Principles and were very similar in concept, though separate in execution.
        </p>
        <p>In the topic of visual communication, Zena O’Connor (2015) focused on the scientific areas of human perception saying that there is still great mystery in the workings of human perception as it starts in the physical eye and processes through the brain, and many external factors can also affect how something is perceived, such as contrast and color. In web design, Craig (2010) emphasized the importance of the law of similarity giving the example of using blue hyperlinks across the web. Similarity carries great importance to the human mind as people look to make sense out of websites or any designed element.
        </p>
        <p>Roy Behrens (1998) wrote on the influential nature of Gestalt Psychology upon the art world, saying it gave “scientific validation of age-old principles” that artists had already been using. By the Gestalt psychologists, these laws were spoken of as “innate tendencies” to group items that appear to belong amongst each other, also called “similarity grouping,” and that such tendencies were evidenced by their “cross-cultural effectiveness” (Behrens, 1998).
        </p>
        <p>With the Gestalt psychologists bringing scientific validity to art concepts, Gestalt principles have flooded art laws and teachings. This holds true for the Law of Similarity and certainly can be seen to affect user experience in any designed element. Specifically in websites, it can easily guide users to view an element incorrectly, or it can bring together a more user-friendly design and cause a better experience to keep users visiting the website in the future.

      <h2 id="analysis">The Law of Similarity and the Toledo Library Website:</h2>
        <p>Using the literature basis that has been given, the Toledo Library website’s highlights section will be analyzed in its use or misuse of the Law of Similarity. As has been mentioned before, the website overall does a great job at user-friendly design. In the picture below, one can see the section that covers highlighted events or programs. The three sections include information on “Books on Tap,” “Authors! Programs,” and “Film Focus Series.” These three sections are updated regularly, and even now if one goes to the website, it will show three different sections.
        </p>
        <img src="Highlights_Section.jpg" alt="Highlights Section on Toledo Library Website" id="section">
        <p>Toledo Library does not label these three items but instead makes use of the Law of Similarity and causes the three boxes to seem connected by their similar design with the exception of the button color at the bottom of each section. The Law of Proximity also applies here as they are in the same area, but the Law of Similarity overrides and applies with this design specifically.
        </p>
        <p>Each of these sections are three individual boxes which would seem to be separate, but each are similar in their design and cause the mind to think they are not only related, but that they make up a larger overall section or element. Each box is the same size and contains the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A picture at the top</li>
          <li>A title below the picture</li>
          <li>A description of the event or program</li>
          <li>And a button at the bottom</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these similarities makes them seem connected and combine to makeup the highlights section. Likewise, the difference in the colors of the buttons keeps them dissimilar enough to know they are not exactly the same and that they are individual events. If these three items were not meant to be viewed together, this design would be ineffective and cause confusion instead of intrigue.
        </p>
        <p id="conclusion">In conclusion, the Toledo Library website has clearly been designed with users in mind, and it shows in their application of the Gestalt Principles. Even the simple use of the Law of Similarity created an engaging, easy to understand event/program highlights section. Most libraries have a section for highlighted programs, and this website effectively places them at the forefront of their website and uses colors, proximity, and similarity to bring them together in an appealing highlights section, which is exactly what is needed.

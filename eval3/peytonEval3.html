      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction </h2>
        <p>The Appalachian Regional Library system website serves patrons for the region and the region’s three individual libraries and gives specific information for each library and the region as a whole. The following evaluation will use Garrett’s 5 planes of User Experience Design in determining how well it has been designed for usability. The five planes are strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="strategy">
      <h2 id="Strategy">Strategy:</h2>
        <p>For a website’s strategy, user needs and business goals should be determined to guide the rest of the website production. The Appalachian Regional Library has an about section that stated its mission statement which is the following:
        </p>
        <p> “The Appalachian Regional Library promotes knowledge, reading, and imagination; supports and encourages lifelong learning; and contributes to the sense of community and the economic wellbeing of Ashe, Wilkes, and Watauga Counties.”
        </p>
        <p> Based on this mission statement the business objectives would be to:
          <ul>
            <li>Give easy access to materials at the library and online,</li>
            <li>Encourage continued research and learning throughout life </li>
            <li>Promote events at the library</li>
            <li>Promote other items that patrons may not know about </li>
            <li>Give access to items that increase economic prosperity in the community. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> The website represents this mission well, and it is especially obvious through the services offered and advertised on the site. The website reveals the regional library’s innovative atmosphere and shows their determination to serve their patrons through events, programs, and other services.
        </p>
        <p>For user needs, they would need to access online materials from the library, access the catalog, know general information about each library such as the hours and library services, and the specific services for each library and by age group; know events around the library, perhaps through access to a newsletter; and lastly access reader’s advisory items.
        </p>
        <p>These needs and objectives are obvious through the areas of the website and clear to see and understand. Library information is clearly given for each library. The website mobile version has a location button (see picture) that takes you to specific information about individual libraries. Otherwise on the desktop version, there is a drop down menu for about the library that gives detailed information.
        </p>
        <p>There is also a library services menu, upcoming events section, and libguides that assist users in different areas. The catalog is a submenu option, and it is a little difficult to find- under books and reading. There is a regional main menu that says “Search the Catalog,” but it takes you to a different website to search the catalog.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="scope">
      <h2>Scope:</h2>
        <p>The second plane is the scope of the website that is broken up into functional requirements and content requirements. The functional requirements recognized on this website are a Catalog entry, New Arrivals section, Upcoming events section, Other Highlighted section, regional menu, and an individual library menu. The Content Requirements were identified as Upcoming event lists, Newest arrival items, Highlighted items, Menu items listed, and informational pages. The catalog entry is on each page, but it is not presented in a way that makes it obvious to find.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="structure">
      <h2>Structure:</h2>
        <p>The structure plane describes the user interaction and information organization on the website. This is split into interaction design and information architecture. For interaction design, the website has menus with drop downs that highlight as you pass over them. The submenu webpage you are on stays highlighted on the menu to inform you what page you are currently looking at.
        </p>
        <p>In the Mobile version there is another menu that stays at the bottom when you scroll. It contains the following links and pictures: social media, location, and contact information. The pictures used for the menu items can be a bit confusing. The one that looks like a person takes you to the catalog which is odd. It would be better if the catalog were represented by a book instead. Perhaps it was meant to represent your account for the catalog. It is still unclear.
        </p>
        <p>There is a new arrivals section that automatically scrolls through items. The user can pause the scrolling or skip ahead to the next new arrival. Highlighted events scroll through automatically also, and you can scroll through manually by swiping on a mobile device or on a computer you can click the left or right arrow. However, the arrows are white and difficult to see. The highlighted events section also does not have an indicator for how many scrolls there are or where you are in the sequence.
        </p>
        <p>Secondly in the Information Architecture section, there are two menus at the top of the page which makes it confusing and busy. However, the two menus are due to it being a regional library system and having the three libraries within the regional website. Mobile version delineates that the top menu is for the whole region which is helpful. The main menu is difficult for the eye to notice as it is simply words with no border or box; it is on a white background; and it has no special font changes to highlight the words.
        </p>
        <p>The website easily allows the user to change library pages by using a bar at the top which serves as a small menu, but just allows the user to go between the three locations and the main regional organization that combines all three. These menus are color coded and when clicked on will keep the color scheme for the rest of the webpage to remind you which library’s website you are on. The colors are incredibly helpful to users in delineating which library they are reading about, and each library has their own menu with their own items and services.
        </p>
        <p>There is an upcoming events list on each library page for the individual library’s events, and there is one on the main page that shows events from all libraries and is also color coded to show which library an event is located. This is a clear and clean way of organizing the upcoming events, so people can easily find what events they are looking for and where they are looking for them.  Other websites have previously just combined all locations for events and other items, and then the user has to sort through a large amount of data to find what they are looking for, but this website allows the user to simply click what library they want and the website will reflect data for that library only.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="skeleton">
      <h2>Skeleton:</h2>
        <p> The next plane is the skeleton of the website which determines the layout and arrangement of the previous mentioned sections. This is split into three areas: interface design, navigation design, and information design.
        </p>
        <p>The layout of the website is consistent throughout the regional section and the individual library sections. Each have the main header with regional menu, the individual library header with the individual library menu, the upcoming events are on the left, and the highlighted section and newest arrivals below that, and lastly at the bottom are another section of three items that are changed to meet the needs of the webpage it is on. There is no large footer at the bottom which makes a clean look.
        </p>
        <p>Overall the website’s main library pages do not have a large amount of content, but they have managed to make them look too busy and muddy at the top. There is little usages of borders around the sections mentioned in the previous paragraph which would have helped the user’s eyes organize the items and see that they are individual sections. There is too much information put into the top header(s), so it makes it difficult for the eye to choose a place to look at when first opening the website.
        </p>
        <p>For the second section of the skeleton plane, the navigation design of the website works averagely. There are too many menus to sort through between the regional menu and the library menu. The library menus also have too many selections. It could be simplified into “about the library,” Services, Books, Beyond Books, and other locations. The three libraries have different menu items for their main menu, which can create confusion when going between those pages. Use of the main five menu items above would be an easy way to simplify the look and create consistency.  The upper menu also needs to have some sort of box around it and label to distinguish what it is and that it is a menu.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, the skeleton plane has an information design section. The main information design of the website is the organization by color to help distinguish the items between libraries. This has been mentioned before, but this allows information to be organized without much effort just by keeping the same use of colors. This makes it easy to design the rest of the website and organize the information based on specific libraries. Each library’s logo is also put at the top header once a library is selected. It can look a little muddied as the regional logo comes first and then the individual library- both a similar size. It creates some confusion as it is right above the regional menu, so it looks like the regional menu is for the individual library when that is not the case.
        </p>

    <div class="surface">
      <h2>Surface:</h2> <!--Insert Surface-->
        <p>The last plane to analyze the website is the surface plane. Not enough usage of borders to create clear separations
        <br>Newest arrivals section doesn’t match the rest of the website with font or color.
    </div>
    <div class="conclusion">
      <h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
        <p> <!--Insert Conclusion-->
